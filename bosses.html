        <h3 id="highlight">1. Malenia, Blade of Miquella/Malenia, Goddess of Rot</h3>
        <div class="character-description">
            <p>
                The battle against Malenia might just be the toughest boss fight that FromSoftware has ever created. That’s not an
                exaggeration. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that this fight might actually be broken.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malenia’s incredible speed and anime-like attack patterns are more than enough to defeat 99% of Elden Ring players, but
                even top-tier FromSoftware fans will struggle to find a solution for the fact that Malenia can actually heal herself
                with every blow she lands. Yes, you heard me right. Malenia restores a significant portion of her health every time she
                lands an attack, and she will land a lot of attacks. Some of the absolute best Elden Ring players have spent days trying
                to beat this boss, and I honestly think this is the one boss in the game the vast majority of players will simply never
                be able to beat.
            </p>
            <P>
                You don’t technically need to beat Maleania without getting hit, but that’s basically what you’ll need to do if you ever
                want to dream of beating this boss. I commend the Elden Ring team for trying something this bold, and I kindly ask that
                they never think of designing a boss like Malenia again.
            </P>

            <h3 id="highlight">2. Beast Clergyman/Maliketh The Black Blade</h3>
            <div class="character-description">
                <p>
                    The Beast Clergyman part of this boss fight is tough enough to be worthy of a lower spot on this list, but it’s
                    insulting to call the fight against Maliketh anything less than one of the hardest fights in Elden Ring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maliketh is able to fly across the arena in a way that can be extremely difficult to properly keep track of. When he
                    lands, he usually delivers hits that can not only kill you an in instant but actually reduce your total health even if
                    you manage to survive them. The only hope you have of beating him is to perfect your defensive techniques and learn to
                    love those few seconds when you may actually be able to deal even a little bit of damage to this boss.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The most impressive thing about this fight is that it’s actually quite “balanced.” This battle is all about learning the
                    patterns and mastering your own timing, which is exactly what a difficult Soulsborne boss fight should come down to.
                </P>

            <h3 id="highlight">3. Godskin Duo</h3>
            <div class="character-description">
                <p>
                    I honestly don’t even want to justify this fight’s existence by acknowledging it, but there’s no way to talk about the
                    toughest fights in Elden Ring without talking about the Godskin Duo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Godskin Duo fight sees you face off against two bosses that share one health bar. The gimmick here is that one boss
                    will always resurrect the other almost immediately after they “die.” That means that you’re only offered just a precious
                    handful of seconds to focus on just one of these already individually tough foes, and that also means that you’re almost
                    constantly forced to find a way to survive against their devastating duo attacks that fill most of the confined space
                    you’re forced to battle them in.
                </p>
                <P>
                    I straight-up hate this fight. It’s honestly a poorly designed and cheap encounter that demands that you use every cheap
                    tactic in your own arsenal to overcome it. Still, it absolutely deserves a place on this list.
                </P>
