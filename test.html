                <p>
                    The battle against Malenia might just be the toughest boss fight that FromSoftware has ever created.
                    That’s not an
                    exaggeration. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that this fight might actually be broken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Malenia’s incredible speed and anime-like attack patterns are more than enough to defeat 99% of
                    Elden Ring players, but
                    even top-tier FromSoftware fans will struggle to find a solution for the fact that Malenia can
                    actually heal herself
                    with every blow she lands. Yes, you heard me right. Malenia restores a significant portion of her
                    health every time she
                    lands an attack, and she will land a lot of attacks. Some of the absolute best Elden Ring players
                    have spent days trying
                    to beat this boss, and I honestly think this is the one boss in the game the vast majority of
                    players will simply never
                    be able to beat.
                </p>
                <P>
                    You don’t technically need to beat Maleania without getting hit, but that’s basically what you’ll
                    need to do if you ever
                    want to dream of beating this boss. I commend the Elden Ring team for trying something this bold,
                    and I kindly ask that
                    they never think of designing a boss like Malenia again.
                </P>
